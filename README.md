- 👋 Hi, I’m @hugo-bonnefous, I have a PhD in bioinformatics and systems biology.
- 👀 I’m interested in evolutionary biology, and more precisely on the evolution of complex systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to analyse biological networks in an evolutionary framework. I am always willingful to learn new methods (data analyses, computer simulations, mathematical modelling...).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any exciting project using bioinformatics or modelling to tackle fundamental evolutionary questions!
